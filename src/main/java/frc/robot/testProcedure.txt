TEST PROCEDURE


0) Ensure cargo arm is at Zero position - robot must be on floor
1) Measure cargo arm angle and update if necessary
2) Put robot in Test mode
3) Move arm to around 90 degrees
4) Press 'A' and verify that reported angle is near -90 degrees
5) Press 'B' and verify that we need a strong positive force (above 0.4) to reach angle "0"
6) Press 'Start' and check to see if new bike brake is strong enough to hold arm
7) Press 'Start' to disengage lock, move arm to around 45 degrees, and press 'Start' again to reengage
8) If lock works, retool code to unbrake when we need to move and rebrake when we are close enough (or let go of manual control buttons)
9) If lock does not work, adjust test goal angle with DPAD down
10) Press 'A' to see the reported arm angle
11) Press 'B' to verify that the force requested makes sense
12) Move arm a little past vertical position
13) Adjust test goal angle to be +15
14) Verify with 'A' that the current angle is beyond 95 degrees
15) Verify with 'B' that NO force is to be applied
16) Adjust test goal angle to be -120
17) Move arm to -100 degrees
18) Verify with 'A' that angle is beyond -95 degrees
19) Verify with 'B' that NO force is to be applied
20) Press 'X' to toggle the arm lock
21) Press 'A' to see angle and 'B' to see attempted force
22) Verify that force reported is not higher than a magnitude of 0.4
23) Verify that this force is reported as 0.4 (or as close as possible) when arm is at 90 degrees
24) Clear the area
25) Ensure brake is NOT applied by pressing 'Start'
26) Verify that the arm lock IS enabled by pressing 'X'
27) Press L2 and R2 at the same time to enable test movement
28) Verify that the arm does not move
29) If the area is safe, move arm manually upwards
30) Verify that the arm still does not move (force should be adjusted)
31) Hold arm to prevent it falling when movement is disabled
32) Press L2 and R2 at the same time to disable test movement
33) Use DPAD up and down to move target angle to -45 degrees
34) Verify with 'A' and 'B' that arm angle is at resting angle (-120?) and that the force applied is positive
35) Clear the area
36) Press L2 and R2 to enable arm movement
37) Verify that the arm moves closer to target and slows as it approaches
38) Verify that the arm does not fall
39) Verify that the arm does not overshoot too far
40) Verify that the arm does not wobble
